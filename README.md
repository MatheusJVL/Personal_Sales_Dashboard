# Personal Sales Dashboard

This project is a personal sales dashboard developed in Python. It allows users to register sales (including product name, price, and date) and stores the data in an SQLite database.

The system also generates sales analytics through graphical reports using `matplotlib`, such as total revenue by date or by product.

Additionally, the dashboard includes a simple linear regression model to predict next month's revenue based on previously collected sales data.

No graphical interface is used â€” all interactions happen via the terminal or command line. The project is modular and ready to be extended with GUI frameworks like PySide6 in the future.
